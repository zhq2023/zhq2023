# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm zhq

I am passionate about Data Analysis, Statistical Modeling, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization. I'm always eager to explore new insights from data and create meaningful visualizations to communicate findings.

## My Interests
- Deep Learning: Specializing in Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, and hybrid models that combine the two.
- Data Analysis: Exploring and deriving insights from datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and valuable information.
- Statistical Modeling: Applying statistical techniques to make predictions, understand relationships, and validate hypotheses.
- Machine Learning: Developing models to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.
- Data Visualization: Creating visual representations that help convey complex information in an accessible and understandable way.


## Collaboration Opportunities

I am open to collaborating on projects related to data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning, or data visualization. If you're working on an interesting project or looking for a teammate, feel free to reach out to me.

## Get in Touch
